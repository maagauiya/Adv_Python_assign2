###### Title:
###### Vitalik Buterin: El Salvador's Bitcoin Approach Is 'Contrary to the Ideals' of Crypto
###### In a surprise Reddit post on Friday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin had strong words for El Salvador's Bitcoin rollout, and specifically President Nayib Bukele for forcing local businesses to accept the top cryptocurrency.
###### After a Reddit user on the r/cryptocurrency subreddit posted: "Unpopular opinion: El Salvador president Mr Nayab (sic) Bukele should not be praised 
###### by crypto community," Buterin replied: "Nothing unpopular about this opinion. Making it mandatory for businesses to accept a specific cryptocurrency is contrary to the ideals of freedom that are supposed to be so important to the crypto space."
###### Buterin's post continued: "This tactic of pushing BTC to millions of people in El Salvador at the same time with almost no attempt at prior education is reckless, and risks a large number of innocent people getting hacked or scammed. Shame on everyone (ok, fine, I'll call out the main people responsible: shame on Bitcoin maximalists) who are uncritically praising him."
###### Indeed, Bukele's embrace of Bitcoin as legal tender, first announced with great fanfare at the Bitcoin Miami conference in June, has earned him raves from some of the loudest voices in Bitcoin. Those same Bitcoin flag-wavers have been less eager to talk about the young president's well-documented authoritarian tendencies and the less savory aspects of his government's Bitcoin rollout. One Salvadoran business owner, requiring anonymity, told Decrypt, "It crushes my soul to see Bitcoin maximalists around the world cheering this when, if they actually sat down and read the law and regulations, it is completely opposite to everything they preach."
###### And Buterin isn't the only voice in crypto speaking out about the contradictions in forcing an open, decentralized technology on business owners.   
###### At the TOKEN2049 conference in London just this week, Blockchain.com co-founder Nicolas Cary said during a panel, "I think there’s some valid criticisms of how the program is rolled out in El Salvador in terms of being top down. One of the main ethos of crypto is that there’s really grassroots adoption, and people are doing it voluntarily."
###### Buterin didn't stop at his first post. Further down in the same thread, when the original poster commented: "It's like [Bukele] pushed it because he bought at cheaper price and knew a country adopting a crypto would alone take the price high enough to make him rich," Buterin replied, "Simpler and dumber hypothesis: both for political reasons and because he's a human being like the rest of us, he just loves being praised by people he considers powerful (ie. Americans). Bitcoin maximalists are a very easy community to get to praise you: you just have to be in a position of power and do or say nice things about them and their coin."
The original poster replied to Buterin: "Elon did the same exact thing, now Bukele exploiting emotions of the community."

###### Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Heading for a Critical Weekly Close, Will $52.9k Hold?
###### BTC had an impressive run this week, managing to push above a key downtrend line and the September high at $52.9k. It managed to hit an intraweek high of $56.1k, digging deeper into the $55k to $58k zone of technical and on-chain resistance.
###### The rally so far has shown profit-taking from much younger coins, while the older cohorts continue to steadily hold. Although many weak hands who bought BTC above $50k earlier this year panic sold during the May liquidation wipe out, we can expect some remaining investors looking to break even add near term selling pressure, especially between $55k to $58k.
###### Given the technical and heavy on-chain realized price distribution in the $55k to $58k zone, it could take BTC multiple attempts to push above these levels, before confirming a large breakout towards the previous all time highs at $64.8k.
###### Near-term technicals, especially on the 4-hour chart, reached moderately overbought levels, suggesting a consolidation or small pullback is needed before preparing for the next major move. At the moment, BTC continues to remain above the September high at $52.9k, a very important level. Bitcoin 
###### needs to make a weekly close above it in order to continue the breakout and validate the bear trap.
###### A weekly close above $52.9k is a very bullish signal and increases the probability of retesting the $55k to $58k zone of resistance. The more resistance is tested, the weaker it becomes, further increasing the probability of breaking above resistance if enough buyers come into the market.       
###### In addition to BTC reaching near-term overbought levels, the past few days saw a slight uptick in spot exchange reserves, as younger coins began to 
###### take profit. This is a near term cautious signal, but we have to keep in mind reserves remain at multi-year lows.
###### Spot exchange reserves have been trending lower the entire year, as investors continued to buy BTC and withdraw from exchanges, adding to the massive supply shock.
###### Bitcoin bulls are anxiously waiting for the weekly close to see if BTC can push above the critical $52.9k level. If they can maintain buying pressure and push BTC above $58k, the probability of retesting all-time significantly increases, as there is much less resistance above $60k.
###### Global Risk-On Trade Coming Back?
###### The SPX managed to hold a key intraweek low and printed multiple daily closes higher suggesting a double bottom and reversal developing. The dollar 
###### has been flat with money flowing out of longer-term bonds suggesting the risk-on trade could be coming back as investors attempt to get past near term uncertainties.
###### Overall, the trend in fundamental, technicals, and on-chain remain firmly bullish, as the long term holders firmly held despite this year’s severe drawdowns, FUD, liquidation events, and uncertainty. The recent price action has shown the bulls are firmly gaining back control from the bears. The 
###### outperformance of Bitcoin relative to other risk assets during major risk-off events in September is a major sign of strength for the largest cryptocurrency, suggesting continuing outperformance once markets resume risk on.
###### The weekly close relative to $52.9k will likely determine BTC’s direction for the coming weeks.
